    title: 'Water',
    info: 'The rule of thumb is to water succulents thoroughly once a week in summer, twice a month in spring and fall, and monthly during their winter dormancy. Keep succulents on the dry side, and give their roots superb drainage. When under-watered, succulents subsist on stored moisture. If the soil dries completely, roots may desiccate and growth cease.'  },

    title: 'Sun and shade',
    info: 'In general, give succulents a day of full sun. Succulents do need adequate light for balanced growth (so they do not stretch), and any succulent—any plant for that matter—that has been cultivated in low-light or in a greenhouse should be introduced gradually to greater sun exposure.'  },

    title: 'Soil and drainage',
    info: 'The best soil for succulents, whether in the ground or in containers, is a coarse, fast-draining mix. You can buy bagged cactus mix, but it is less expensive to make your own.'  },

    title: 'Pest control',
    info: 'Prevent infestations by giving succulents excellent air circulation. Spray pests with 70% rubbing alcohol diluted 50% with water. Isolate any infested plants immediately to keep the pests from spreading, and thoroughly clean the area.'  },
