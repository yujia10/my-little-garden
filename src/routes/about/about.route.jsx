          <p>Succulent comes from the Latin word "sucus," which means juice. It's also a nod to the nourishing leaves that help these plants survive in extremely warm conditions</p>

          <p>Succulents first cropped up in areas with long dry seasons (such as Africa), since they store water in their leaves.</p>

          <p>You can use succulent cuttings to grow new plants. It's called "propagating." To do this, snip off a succulent leaf, let it dry in the sun, and plant it in dirt and water.</p>
